# mishmashmoji
MishMashMoji is a color emoji font available as both OpenType-SVG and COLRv1.
To have the font work in all browsers, read [my blog post](https://fullystacked.net/posts/new-font-face-syntax/#:~:text=Using%20color%20fonts%20with%20tech()).

Some of the glyphs are taken from the open source Kablammo typeface, designed by Travis Kochel, with creative direction by Travis Kochel and Lizy Gershenzon, at Vectro Type. I colored them in.

The blob glyphs are customised and colored versions of the black and white Noto Emoji font, with some outlines from Kablammo. 

I also randomly included some unedited versions of emoji I like from the old Firefox emoji font, the Twitter emoji font, and the Microsoft emoji font. 

Thank you to all the original creators. 

This font only covers a very limited set of emoji.
